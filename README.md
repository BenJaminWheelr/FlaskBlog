# FlaskBlog
A blog website created using Flask, Bootstrap, and a SQLite Database.
This blog features include User Registration in which their password is stored in a sha256 hash. Users can also comment but only the admin can post, edit, and delete blog posts. This blog demonstrates my ability to create user registration forms, store users information, be able to update blog post informaation in the SQlite Db, along with being able to restrict access to certain web directories that only the admin can visit.
